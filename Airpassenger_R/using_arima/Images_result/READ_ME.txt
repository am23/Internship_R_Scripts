This file contains the description for Aircomp_1.png

The image shows the brown curve from 1952 and the prediction
it shows from there-on is not even near to reasonable.
The reason is it is plotted just after a sharp dip from the
end of 1951 and hence it follows that trend.

This discrepancy has been solved in the comp_arima_se.r code.
